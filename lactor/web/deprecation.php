<h1>End of support for Internet Explorer 8</h1>
<p>
As of April 8, 2014, Microsoft is dicontuing support for Windows XP. We have
continued to support Internet Explorer 8 because any users of Windows XP
are unable to install later versions of this browser. Since Microsoft
will no longer be supporting Windows XP after this date, we feel it 
is no longer necessary.
</p>
<p>
This change will allow us to increase security on Lactor and keep
your information even safer than we already do. This will also allow us to add 
new features at a faster pace.
</p>
<p>
If you need to continue using Windows XP, we recommend you download an
alternative browser, such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. These browsers
will continue to be updated and will provide the necessary security. After
April 8, Internet Explorer on Windows XP may no longer be able to connect
to Lactor. We apologize for any inconvenience this change may cause.
</p>
<p>
If you are using Internet Explorer 8 on Windows Vista or later, the browser 
should continue to function on Lactor, though we still recommend an update
to increase security not only on lactor, but other places on the web as well.
