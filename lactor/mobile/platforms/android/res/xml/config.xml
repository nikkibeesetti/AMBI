       LACTOR is an innovative, interactive web-based breastfeeding monitoring 
       system. LACTOR was created to help breastfeeding mothers monitor their 
       breastfeeding patterns and detect early breastfeeding problems. The 
       lactation consultant can also monitor mothers' data and intervene 
       immediately in case of a breastfeeding problem. Mothers also receive 
       notifications if they have any breastfeeding problem with suggestions 
       to help solve the problem.
